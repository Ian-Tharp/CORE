# Cognitive-CORE

## Introduction
Cognitive CORE is an advanced template for building systems towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It stands for Comprehension, Orchestration, Reasoning, and Evaluation â€” the four pillars that provide a modular and scalable foundation for autonomous task execution and decision-making using natural language inputs.

## Architecture
The system is structured around the CORE principles, with each component serving a specific function in the task resolution process:

- **Comprehension**: Interprets user inputs and transforms them into structured tasks.
- **Orchestration**: Coordinates task flows between system components and manages the lifecycle of tasks.
- **Reasoning**: Applies logic and decision-making to process tasks and derive solutions.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses the outcomes of tasks for quality assurance and relevance to the original input.

## Technologies
Cognitive CORE is built using Python and integrates FastAPI for exposing its functionalities through HTTP endpoints, enabling easy access and extensibility.

## Setup and Installation
Provide step-by-step instructions on setting up the project, including environment setup, dependencies installation, and how to start the server.
