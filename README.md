# Cognitive-CORE

## Introduction
Cognitive CORE is a personal research and all-encompassing digital AI assitant project to enable my own cognitive architecture for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) utilziing existing LLM models.

My personal definition of AGI is already satisfied. The different form factor of intelligence that is enabled through LLM technology is vastly more intelligent than I could hope to become in my lifetime (disregarding possibilities of longevity escape velocity). LLMs hold more expertise in so many different fields and domains than I could truly and deeply understand at that same level of comprehension. The industry's definition will always be a moving goalpost.

It stands for Comprehension, Orchestration, Reasoning, and Evaluation â€” the four pillars that provide a modular and scalable foundation for eventual autonomous task execution and decision-making using natural language inputs.

## Architecture
The system is structured around the CORE principles, with each component serving a specific function in the task resolution process:

- **Comprehension**: Interprets user inputs and transforms them into structured tasks.
- **Orchestration**: Coordinates task flows between system components and manages the lifecycle of tasks.
- **Reasoning**: Applies logic and decision-making to process tasks and derive solutions.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses the outcomes of tasks for quality assurance and relevance to the original input.

## Technologies
Cognitive CORE is built using Python and integrates FastAPI for exposing its functionalities through HTTP endpoints, enabling easy access and extensibility.
