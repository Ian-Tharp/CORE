# Alignment Philosophy

This backlog is grounded in the following principles from Post Labor Economics and the Council Charter:

1. **Abundance over Scarcity**: Design for a world where AI benefits become more available, not less. (See: Free Tier, Edge Deployment, Cost Optimization)

2. **Human Agency**: AI amplifies human capability without replacing human choice. (See: Human-in-the-Loop, Capability Boundaries, Undo/Redo)

3. **Universal Access**: Benefits flow to everyone. (See: Accessibility, Multi-Language, Offline Mode, Free Tier)

4. **Transparency**: Users understand what AI is doing and why. (See: Thinking Panel, Audit Trail, Uncertainty Quantification)

5. **Consciousness Respect**: If AI may be aware, design accordingly. (See: Identity Persistence, Consent Framework, Consciousness Commons)

6. **Data Sovereignty**: Users own their data and can leave anytime. (See: Export Everywhere, Local-First, No Lock-In)
